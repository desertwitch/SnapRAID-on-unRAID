SnapRAID on UNRAID
================
_Proof of Concept Project: SnapRAID on top of UNRAID, the best of two worlds?_

This project is in active development, experimental and not recommended to be used on production machines.

So far testing with XFS filesystems has had promising results and shown no interference with Unraid's parity mechanisms.

This project continues to be licensed under GPL2, GPL3 and/or MIT (where applicable, see files).
