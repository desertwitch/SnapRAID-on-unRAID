SnapRAID on UNRAID
================
_Proof of Concept Project: SnapRAID on top of UNRAID, the best of two worlds?_

This project is in active development, highly experimental and not recommended to be used on production machines.

So far testing with XFS filesystems has had promising results, however this was without Unraid parity also in effect.

Testing will be continued with Unraid parity also in effect, the results will be published here as soon as possible.
