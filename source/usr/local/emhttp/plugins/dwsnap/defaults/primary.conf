# SnapRAID configuration file

# Use trailing slashes (/mnt/disk1->/mnt/disk1/) for folders


# Recommended excludes:
# Unrecoverables and often changing paths (System, Docker, VMs)
exclude *.unrecoverable
exclude /system/
exclude /appdata/
exclude /domains/

# Recommended auto-save during SYNC operations (in GB):
# In case of interruptions no need to start from scratch,
# also easier recovery in case of disk failure during SYNC
#
# Caution: This setting means total GB read from all disks:
# autosave 1500 (total GB) /  4 (HDDs) = save every 375 GB
# autosave 1500 (total GB) / 10 (HDDs) = save every 150 GB
# autosave 1500 (total GB) / 20 (HDDs) = save every  75 GB
autosave 1500
